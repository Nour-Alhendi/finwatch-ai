# FinWatch AI

**AI-powered Financial Risk Assessment & Decision Support System**

> Monitors 55 stocks and 10 sector ETFs daily — detects anomalies, classifies risk severity, and produces an explainable trading signal for every asset.

## What It Does

Most anomaly detection systems stop at the flag: *"something is unusual here."*  
That is not enough to act on.

FinWatch AI goes further. It answers the question that actually matters after an anomaly is detected:

**Is the price still falling — or has it already bottomed out? Should I act now, or wait?**

The system produces a concrete, explainable recommendation (`ENTRY` / `HOLD` / `EXIT`) for every monitored asset, grounded in:

- Anomaly severity (4-model ensemble)
- Drawdown probability (XGBoost, AUC 0.6671)
- Market regime (Bull / Bear / Transition)
- Valuation fundamentals (P/E, P/B, revenue growth)
- News sentiment (VADER + LLM analyst opinion)
- Momentum recovery signals

## ML Architecture

The system runs an **8-layer modular pipeline**:

| Layer | Name | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Data Ingestion | Downloads 10 years of daily OHLCV for 65 assets |
| 2 | Data Quality | Validates schema, detects OHLC violations, gaps, stale prices |
| 3 | Feature Engineering | 30+ features: returns, RSI, momentum, regime, ETF context, sector comparison |
| 4 | Anomaly Detection | 4-model ensemble → weighted continuous score (0–1) |
| 5 | Prediction + Fundamentals | Drawdown probability + meta-model stacking + valuation signals |
| 6 | Decision Engine | Severity classification + trading signal, regime- and momentum-aware |
| 7 | Explainability + Sentiment | SHAP drivers + VADER + Groq LLM narrative |
| 8 | Reporting + Dashboard | Streamlit dashboard + audit log + daily management summary |

### Anomaly Detection — Ensemble of 4 Models

| Model | Count | Weight | What it detects |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| LSTM Autoencoder | 30 (sector × volatility bucket) | 0.30 | Temporal sequence anomalies |
| Isolation Forest | 14 (per sector) | 0.30 | Multivariate outliers |
| Return Z-Score | — | 0.20 | Distribution outliers (±3σ, 20d + 60d window) |
| Sector Z-Score | — | 0.20 | Stock vs. sector peer deviation |

Combined into a single `anomaly_score_weighted` (0–1 continuous) per ticker per day.

### Prediction — XGBoost + Meta-Model Stacking

- **Target:** P(max drawdown > 5% over next 20 days)
- **Model:** XGBoost binary classifier
- **AUC:** 0.6671 on holdout set (2024–2026, unseen during training)
- **Meta-model:** Logistic Regression stacking — combines `p_drawdown` + anomaly signals + VIX into `p_drawdown_meta`

### Decision Engine — Severity + Trading Signal

**Severity classification** (priority-ordered rules):

| Priority | Condition | Severity |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | `p_drawdown ≥ threshold` AND `anomaly_score ≥ 0.30` | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Actual 30d drawdown ≤ −15% | CRITICAL |
| 3 | `p_drawdown` OR `anomaly_score ≥ 0.30` | WARNING |
| 4 | Actual drawdown ≤ −8% | WARNING |
| 5 | `anomaly_score ≥ 0.20` OR moderate `p_drawdown` | WATCH |
| 6 | `p_drawdown < 30%` + RSI < 70 + positive momentum | POSITIVE_SIGNAL |

VIX-aware: thresholds are raised at low VIX (< 20) to reduce false positives in calm markets.

**Trading signal** — momentum-recovery aware:

For `WARNING` severity, the system distinguishes between stocks still declining vs. those actively recovering:
- `momentum_5 > 0.03` (active recovery) + weak ML signal → `HOLD`
- Strong ML signal (`p_dd ≥ 0.50`) + no recovery → `EXIT`

Valuation gates: blocks `ENTRY` on negative or extreme P/E (> 50); strengthens `POSITIVE_SIGNAL` on cheap fundamentals.

## Backtesting Results

Walk-forward setup — no lookahead bias. 4-year rolling train window, 6-month test windows.

| Signal | Avg 20d Return | Drawdown Rate |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| ENTRY  | +3.37%         | 17%           |
| HOLD   | +2.94%         | 26%           |
| EXIT   | +3.79%         | 36%           |

Risk ordering is correct: `EXIT` signals carry the highest drawdown rate, `ENTRY` the lowest. The system correctly identifies which situations are most dangerous.

## Key Design Decisions

**Why an ensemble of 4 anomaly detectors?**  
Each model has different blind spots. LSTM captures temporal patterns, Isolation Forest finds multivariate outliers, Z-Score catches distribution extremes. The ensemble is more robust than any single model.

**Why not just use the anomaly score to trigger EXIT?**  
An anomaly means something unusual happened — not that the price is still falling. A stock can spike down and immediately recover. The prediction layer (drawdown probability) adds the time dimension: *will this continue?*

**Why momentum-aware EXIT logic?**  
Early testing showed 46 stocks triggering EXIT even when prices had already recovered. By gating EXIT on both strong ML conviction (`p_dd ≥ 0.50`) and absence of recovery momentum, the signal count dropped from 46 to 34 — with qualitatively better signal quality.

**Why SHAP + LLM?**  
SHAP tells you *which features* drove the model decision. The LLM (Groq / llama-3.3-70b) translates that into plain English for non-technical stakeholders, grounded strictly on model outputs to avoid hallucination.

## Stress Testing

11 data corruption scenarios injected at controlled rates to validate the quality pipeline:

Missing values, price spikes, zero values, duplicate rows, wrong dates, stale prices, OHLC violations, zero volume, extreme overnight gaps, negative volume, timestamp conflicts.

All scenarios are caught before corrupt data reaches the feature engineering layer.

- Per-stock view: severity badge, trading signal, price chart, RSI, LLM narrative, SHAP drivers
- Portfolio view: severity distribution across all assets
- Sector ETF overview
- AI Analyst Report: PDF export in English, German, and Arabic (via Groq translation)

## Scope

This is a **monitoring and decision-support framework** for human analysts — not a trading bot and not investment advice. It runs on daily OHLCV data and is designed to be the analytical layer before a human makes a decision.

---

## Planned

- AI Agent with RAG — natural language Q&A over portfolio state ("Why is TSLA flagged? What do analysts say?")
- Real-time / intraday data (1h candles)
- Alert delivery via email or Slack
- Expanded universe (international markets, crypto)
